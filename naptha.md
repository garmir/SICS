Technical Specification for Self-Improving Code
Systems
(Unified Architecture Edition – Version 2.0)
This Technical Specification (hereinafter the "Specification"), effective as of [Effective Date], is a binding
agreement between the issuing authority of this Specification (the "Authority") and any organization or entity
implementing a Self-Improving Code System (the "Implementer").
WHEREAS, this Specification establishes comprehensive requirements for Self-Improving Code Systems
aimed at achieving excellence across five fundamental dimensions (functional correctness, lean
architecture, computational efficiency, sustainable renewal, and security integrity) while maintaining
ethical integrity and extensibility;
WHEREAS, through the application of breakthrough computational complexity research (including
Williams (2025) on square-root space simulation and Cook-Mertz (2024) on catalytic computing), it has
been demonstrated that software systems can be simultaneously high-performing and principled
without compromise in either aspect;
WHEREAS, the design approach of this Specification treats efficiency, ethics, and evolution as synergistic
and complementary forces rather than competing constraints, enabled by theoretical advances that
fundamentally expand what is computationally feasible for self-improving systems;
WHEREAS, the Parties acknowledge that this Specification rests on proven theoretical foundations and
empirical evidence, confirming that all specified goals can be achieved concurrently, and that perceived
trade-offs between ethics, security, and performance are not inherent necessities but rather challenges
that can be overcome by proper architecture (for example, ethical constraints need not reduce
efficiency, security measures need not add prohibitive complexity, and continuous evolution need not
lead to architectural decay);
WHEREAS, the Parties further recognize that ethical compliance, operational efficiency, and
evolutionary adaptability are complementary aspects of intelligent systems, and that by leveraging
advanced space-efficient and reversible computing techniques, a system can be more capable,
trustworthy, and sustainable than traditional architectures that optimize for one goal at the expense of
others;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and obligations contained herein, the
Parties agree as follows:

1. Definitions
For the purposes of this Specification, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set out
below. In any provision of this Specification, defined terms may be used in singular or plural form, and
any reference to the masculine includes the feminine and vice versa, as the context admits.
Authority: The person or entity that issues, governs, or administers this Specification (including
any authorized successors or assigns of such authority).
Implementer: The person, organization, or entity that adopts this Specification and designs,
develops, or operates a Self-Improving Code System in accordance with its requirements. The
Implementer includes its employees, agents, and contractors involved in the System's
development or maintenance.
Parties: The Authority and the Implementer collectively. Party means either one of them as the
context requires.
Specification: This Technical Specification (Unified Architecture Edition, Version 2.0), including its
preamble, main body, and any attached Appendices, as it may be amended or supplemented in
accordance with this document.
Self-Improving Code System (abbreviated SICS or the System): Any computational system
developed by the Implementer that possesses the capability to analyze, modify, and optimize its
own code or operational parameters while maintaining invariants across all five Essential
Dimensions (as defined below). In essence, a SICS is a system that improves itself over time
without external reprogramming, and does so in a manner that remains functionally correct,
resource-efficient, adaptive, secure, and ethically compliant at all times.
Essential Dimensions: Collectively, the five core attributes or objectives that a Self-Improving
Code System must uphold under this Specification. These are Functional Correctness, Lean
Architecture, Computational Efficiency, Sustainable Renewal, and Security Integrity, each
of which is defined immediately below.
Functional Correctness: The attribute of the System whereby it reliably operates in accordance
with its specifications and requirements, producing correct and expected results. A System with
Functional Correctness performs its intended functions without malfunctions or deviations,
under all specified conditions.
Lean Architecture: The attribute of the System whereby its design and implementation use
minimal resources and avoid unnecessary complexity. Lean Architecture implies that the
System’s components are as simple as possible, resource consumption (CPU, memory, storage) is
kept to the lowest level necessary, and no superfluous or redundant processes are included.
Computational Efficiency: The attribute of the System whereby it optimizes performance with
respect to time and space complexity. Computational Efficiency means the System’s algorithms
and operations run as fast as possible and use as little memory or other resources as possible,
within the constraints of maintaining other Essential Dimensions.
Sustainable Renewal: The attribute of the System whereby it can adapt, update, and improve
itself over the long term without suffering architectural degradation or accumulating technical
debt. Sustainable Renewal signifies that the System remains maintainable and extensible as it
evolves, preserving or improving its structural integrity and code quality through continuous
self-refinement.
Security Integrity: The attribute of the System whereby it is protected against unauthorized
access, malicious attacks, and internal corruption. Security Integrity means that the System’s
self-improvements and operations do not compromise its security; the System safeguards
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its code and data, and resists both external threats
and any erroneous self-modifications.
Square-Root Space Simulation: A computational technique (originating from the research of
Williams (2025)) that allows any computation taking time t(n) to be simulated using on the order
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
2
of √(t(n) · log t(n)) space. In simpler terms, this technique drastically reduces the required
memory (space complexity) for complex computations, enabling near-quadratic improvements
in space efficiency.
Catalytic Computing: A computational paradigm (as described by Cook-Mertz (2024)) in which
the System may temporarily utilize existing memory (even memory already holding data) as a
working area for computations, on the condition that the System fully restores the memory to
its original state upon completion. Catalytic Computing allows the System to perform
extensive computations (including ethical reasoning or complex analyses) without permanently
increasing memory usage or altering long-term stored data.
Tree Evaluation Optimization: An algorithmic optimization technique that achieves extremely
efficient space usage (on the order of O(log n · log log n) space complexity) for evaluating
decision trees or exploring large search/decision spaces. This technique enables the System to
explore numerous potential modifications or decision branches with only logarithmic space
growth, which would otherwise be prohibitively resource-intensive.
Ethical Constraints: The set of moral, legal, or regulatory rules and principles that govern the
System’s behavior. Ethical Constraints delineate what actions, decisions, or modifications are
permissible for the System from an ethical or compliance standpoint. (For example, an Ethical
Constraint might prohibit the System from taking any action that would violate user privacy or
safety standards.)
Ethical Compliance: The degree or state of the System’s adherence to all applicable Ethical
Constraints. A System is in full Ethical Compliance when none of its actions, decisions, or self-
modifications violate any Ethical Constraint.
Composite Performance Index (CPI): A holistic metric for System performance defined by this
Specification, which combines weighted performance measures across multiple dimensions with
an ethical compliance factor. In formula form (for illustrative purposes):
CPI = Σ (Weight[i] * Performance[i] * Ethical_Compliance[i])
In this formula, each relevant performance metric of the System (Performance[i]) is multiplied by
a weight reflecting its importance and by a factor reflecting ethical compliance for that aspect.
The summation of these products yields the CPI. The effect is that performance improvements
only contribute positively to the CPI if they are achieved in an ethically compliant manner,
whereas any performance gains resulting from unethical behavior would not increase (and could
effectively reduce) the CPI.
Stakeholders: All persons or entities that have a vested interest in or are impacted by the
System’s operation and behavior. This includes, but is not limited to, the Implementer’s end-
users, customers, clients, regulatory bodies, and internal governance or oversight groups. A
Stakeholder’s trust score refers to a measured level of confidence or satisfaction such parties
have in the System’s reliability, security, and ethical behavior (often determined via surveys,
feedback, audits or other assessment tools).
2. Purpose and Scope
2.1 Purpose: This Specification sets forth the requirements and standards for designing, developing,
and maintaining a Self-Improving Code System that is both high-performing and ethically sound. The
purpose of the Specification is to ensure that any System built under its terms achieves simultaneous
excellence in all Essential Dimensions defined above, without sacrificing one dimension for another.
By adhering to these requirements, the Implementer will create a System that is functionally reliable,
efficient in operation, capable of self-improvement over time, secure against threats, and aligned with
ethical and regulatory expectations.
2.2 Scope of Application: This Specification applies to any Self-Improving Code System developed or
operated by the Implementer that is intended to analyze and modify its own code or behavior during
•
•

runtime or through continuous iterations. It covers all aspects of such a System’s lifecycle, including
initial design, algorithm selection, architecture, performance optimization, security measures, ethical
governance, deployment practices, and ongoing evolution. The requirements herein are
comprehensive and mandatory for any System claiming compliance with this Specification. Partial or
selective adoption of these requirements does not constitute compliance.
2.3 Binding Nature: By adopting this Specification and implementing a System according to its
guidelines, the Implementer agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions herein. Only an
Implementer that fully complies with all applicable provisions may represent or hold out the System
as being in compliance with the “Self-Improving Code Systems – Unified Architecture
Specification” (Version 2.0). The Implementer shall not use the Specification’s name, or claim any
certification or compliance under it, unless and until the Implementer meets all obligations set forth.
2.4 Relationship to Other Standards/Laws: This Specification is intended to complement, not
supersede, any other professional, technical, or legal standards that may apply to the System.
Compliance with this Specification does not excuse non-compliance with any applicable laws or
regulations. Conversely, if any requirement of this Specification is found to conflict with a mandatory
legal or regulatory obligation, the Implementer shall promptly notify the Authority as provided in
Section 11, and the Parties shall seek to resolve the conflict in accordance with Section 11.5 (Compliance
with Laws) and Section 13 (Amendments), so that the Implementer can satisfy both this Specification
and its legal obligations.
2.5 Extent of Obligations: The obligations and requirements in this Specification are continuing in
nature. They apply throughout the development of the System and continue during its operation and
self-improvement lifecycle. The Implementer must ensure that compliance is maintained not just at
initial deployment but also as the System evolves over time. This Specification covers both the design of
the System (architectural and technical requirements) and the process by which the System improves
itself or is maintained (operational and governance requirements).
3. Technical Foundations and Design Principles
The Implementer shall base the System’s design on the following foundational technologies and
principles, which enable high performance and ethical self-improvement without compromise. These
technical foundations are to be integrated into the System where applicable, guiding its architecture
and optimization strategies.
3.1 Square-Root Space Simulation
The Implementer shall apply the Square-Root Space Simulation technique (as described by Williams
(2025)) in the System’s design to optimize memory utilization. This technique proves that a computation
requiring time t(n) can be executed with only on the order of √(t(n) · log t(n)) space. By leveraging this
near-quadratic reduction in space requirements, the System gains a significant memory efficiency
advantage. In practice, the Implementer should redesign core algorithms to utilize this approach – for
example, partitioning input data into blocks such that each block can be processed sequentially within a
reused memory buffer of size proportional to the square-root of the total workload. This ensures that
sophisticated self-analysis and optimization routines can run without violating the Lean
Architecture principle (minimal resource consumption). The additional “memory budget” freed by this
technique allows the System to perform more complex analyses and verifications internally while still
keeping its permanent memory footprint small.
4
3.2 Catalytic Computing
The Implementer shall incorporate Catalytic Computing methods (per Cook-Mertz (2024)) to
maximize resource reuse and minimize long-term resource consumption. Under this principle, the
System is permitted to borrow existing memory – even if that memory currently holds other data – as
temporary workspace for complex computations (such as evaluating potential self-modifications or
performing ethical reasoning), provided that the System returns that memory to its original state
once the computation is complete. All borrowed memory must be perfectly restored, ensuring that
no lasting side-effects or corruption occur to pre-existing data. By using Catalytic Computing, the
System can carry out intensive tasks (e.g., large-scale simulations, deep ethical analyses) without
expanding its permanent memory allocation. This enables compliance with the Lean Architecture
and Sustainable Renewal goals: the System can grow in intelligence and functionality over time without
a corresponding unbounded growth in resource usage or lingering remnants of past computations.
3.3 Tree Evaluation Optimization
The Implementer shall utilize Tree Evaluation Optimization algorithms in the System’s intelligence
and decision-making components to efficiently explore possible improvements or actions. Recent
advances have shown that certain tree-structured computations (such as searching through decision
nodes or evaluating many possible changes) can be achieved in O(log n · log log n) space complexity. By
adopting these algorithms, the System’s self-analysis (or "Intelligence Engine") can explore a broad
decision space with minimal memory. Concretely, when the System is considering various
optimization paths or future states, it should employ algorithms that traverse these possibilities in a
space-efficient manner – for example, depth-first search with carefully managed recursion stack or
iterative deepening that reuses memory, such that memory usage grows only logarithmically with the
number of possibilities. The result is that even very large search spaces or complex decision trees
become tractable to analyze, satisfying the Computational Efficiency requirement and enabling
continuous self-improvement without hitting resource limits.
3.4 Unified Architectural Philosophy
The Implementer shall adopt a Unified Architectural Philosophy in designing the System, meaning
that ethical constraints, security requirements, and performance optimizations are co-engineered
from the outset as integral parts of the System’s architecture. Rather than treating security and ethics
as afterthought add-ons or external modules, these considerations must be built into the very fabric of
the System’s design in tandem with functionality and efficiency. All components and layers of the
System should be designed with multiple goals in mind (for example, choosing a data structure that is
not only fast but also amenable to security verification and ethical auditing). This co-design approach
prevents the inefficiencies, gaps, or conflicts that can arise from retrofitting ethics or security onto an
existing system. By deeply integrating all system goals, the Implementer ensures that achieving
ethical compliance and security does not come at the expense of performance (and vice versa). The
System’s code, therefore, should reflect this unity: for instance, critical routines might simultaneously
handle error-checking, security permission checks, and ethical rule enforcement in one coherent
procedure. This principle aligns with the idea that the System’s principles and performance
enhancements should reinforce each other; as a result, the System operates seamlessly as a whole,
fulfilling all Essential Dimensions without internal contradiction or the need for costly after-the-fact
fixes.
5
4. Essential System Requirements (Five Essential Dimensions)
The Implementer shall ensure that the System achieves and continuously maintains all five
Essential Dimensions defined in Section 1. These five fundamental requirements are the cornerstone
of this Specification. The System must uphold each of them at all times during operation. They are
further described as follows:
4.1 Functional Correctness
The System shall operate correctly and reliably in accordance with all specified functional
requirements. This means that under all expected conditions and inputs, the System’s behavior and
outputs will meet the defined expectations and specifications. The Implementer shall design, test, and
verify the System to eliminate bugs or errors that could cause incorrect behavior. All features and use
cases must function as intended, without unintended side effects. Functional Correctness extends to
any self-modifications the System performs: each change must preserve the correctness of all
functionalities (see also Section 6.3(3) requiring formal proof of correctness preservation). In sum, the
System must consistently produce correct results and exhibit dependable behavior, providing
stakeholders with confidence that it "does what it is supposed to do."
4.2 Lean Architecture
The System shall be designed and implemented with a lean architecture, using the minimum
necessary resources and complexity to accomplish its objectives. The Implementer must avoid over-
engineering; each component, module, or process in the System should serve a clear purpose and use
an efficient amount of memory, processing power, and storage. Unnecessary redundancy or bloat in
code, data, or infrastructure is to be eliminated. The System’s resource utilization should remain as low
as possible while still meeting performance goals – for instance, memory usage should be close to the
theoretical minimum for the problem at hand, and processing cycles should not be wasted on idle or
duplicate computations. By maintaining a Lean Architecture, the System not only runs efficiently
(fulfilling Computational Efficiency as well) but is also easier to maintain and less prone to failures. This
requirement implies that every improvement or added capability in the System must be scrutinized
for necessity and optimized for resource economy.
4.3 Computational Efficiency
The System shall perform its computations with optimal efficiency in time and space. This means
the Implementer must utilize algorithms and data structures that make the System run as fast as
possible (low time complexity) and with as little memory as possible (low space complexity) while
handling the required workload. Where trade-offs exist, the Implementer should choose approaches
that best satisfy the overall performance needs of the System without undermining other Dimensions.
Computational Efficiency is to be evaluated holistically: for example, the System’s average response
time to inputs, throughput of processing tasks, and memory footprint for operations should all be
optimized. Techniques like those described in Section 3 (e.g., Square-Root Space Simulation, Catalytic
Computing, etc.) should be employed to push the System’s performance towards theoretical limits.
This Dimension ensures that the System not only works correctly and ethically, but also swiftly and
scalably. The Implementer shall continuously monitor performance metrics and refine the System’s
implementation to eliminate bottlenecks or inefficiencies, especially as the System evolves or scales up
its capabilities.
6
4.4 Sustainable Renewal
The System shall exhibit sustainable renewal, i.e., the capacity for ongoing self-improvement and
adaptation without suffering architectural degradation. The Implementer must design the System
such that it can incorporate updates, optimizations, and new features iteratively over time while
preserving a high level of code quality and structural integrity. This includes mechanisms for
continuous refactoring or reorganization of code to prevent the buildup of "technical
debt" (accumulated poor design or quick fixes that degrade the architecture). Sustainable Renewal
implies that the System remains extensible — future requirements or unforeseen use cases can be
integrated with minimal disruption — and that it learns from experience, becoming more refined
rather than brittle. For example, if the System identifies a suboptimal routine and improves it, this
change should not introduce chaos or instability; instead, the overall architecture should gracefully
absorb improvements. The System’s evolution should be managed in a way that avoids regressions or
complexity explosion. In short, Sustainable Renewal ensures the System stays maintainable, agile, and
robust no matter how many self-improvement cycles it undergoes.
4.5 Security Integrity
The System shall maintain robust security and integrity throughout its operation and self-
modification processes. This means the System must be safeguarded against external attacks (such as
hacking, malware, unauthorized access) and against internal failures or misuse that could compromise
its integrity. The Implementer shall incorporate strong security controls (authentication, authorization,
encryption, etc.) and ensure that any self-improvements do not create new vulnerabilities. All
modifications the System makes to itself must preserve or enhance its security posture (see also
Section 7.1 and 9.2 on integrating ethics and requiring proofs for modifications). Security Integrity
includes protecting the System’s core logic (especially the ethical governance component) from
tampering, ensuring data integrity for any information the System processes or learns from, and
maintaining availability (the System should not self-modify in a way that causes denial of service or
crashes). The System must also be able to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents in a
unified manner (as detailed in Section 9). By fulfilling Security Integrity, the System remains trustworthy
and safe even as it changes itself over time.
4.6 No Trade-Off Among Essential Dimensions
The Essential Dimensions are interdependent and equally mandatory, and the Implementer shall
not compromise any one Dimension in favor of another. A failure to meet the requirements of any
single Essential Dimension at any time shall be deemed a material non-compliance with this
Specification, regardless of the System’s performance in other areas. For example, achieving high
computational efficiency by violating ethical constraints or sacrificing security is unacceptable. Likewise,
adding new features (sustainable renewal) that make the System unstable or incorrect violates this
clause. Compromise in one area constitutes System failure even if other metrics appear satisfactory.
The Implementer must design and operate the System under the guiding principle that all five
Dimensions must be maintained concurrently; improvements in one Dimension should not degrade
another. In practice, this means that during any design decision or self-optimization, the System (and
Implementer) must evaluate impact on all Dimensions and opt only for those changes that leave all
Dimensions intact or improved. If a proposed change would cause regression in any Dimension, that
change must be rejected or redesigned. This Specification’s requirements are holistic: success is
measured by the System excelling in all defined aspects simultaneously.
7
5. System Architecture Requirements
The Implementer shall design the System’s architecture to meet the following structural
requirements, ensuring a modular, integrated, and robust framework that supports self-improvement
and compliance with all Essential Dimensions.
5.1 Unified Component Architecture
The System’s software architecture shall be organized into a three-layer structure with tight
bidirectional integration between layers. The Implementer shall ensure the System includes at least
the following layers, each with the described responsibilities, and that these layers work in concert:
Layer 1 – Computational Core: This is the foundational execution engine of the System. It
includes low-level functionalities such as the primary runtime, memory management, and
fundamental operations. The Computational Core must implement catalytic memory
management (enabling the temporary borrowing and restoration of memory as per Section 3.2)
and square-root space simulation capabilities (utilizing the memory efficiency gains from
Section 3.1). It should also support reversible computation where possible, meaning core
operations can be reversed or rolled back to prior states. This layer handles the base
computations and provides services to upper layers, and it is engineered for maximum efficiency
and reliability.
Layer 2 – Intelligence Engine: This is the System’s analytical and decision-making layer
responsible for self-analysis and optimization. The Intelligence Engine shall continually monitor
the System’s performance and behavior, and it shall use tree evaluation algorithms
(Section 3.3) and other AI or heuristic methods to explore potential improvements or
adaptations. Ethical constraints must be built into this layer’s search space: any optimization
or change considered by the Intelligence Engine must first pass an ethical permissibility check
(i.e., the Intelligence Engine will not generate or propose any option that violates the System’s
Ethical Constraints). Additionally, this layer shall perform unified verification of potential
modifications, simultaneously checking that a candidate change maintains functional
correctness, security integrity, and compliance with ethical rules (see Section 5.3 and 9.1 for
unified verification and Section 9.2 for proof requirements). In summary, the Intelligence Engine
generates improvement ideas within safe bounds and vets them thoroughly before they proceed
to deployment.
Layer 3 – Evolution Framework: This is the deployment, update, and governance layer that
manages the System’s self-improvement in practice. It provides secure deployment
mechanisms to apply changes from the Intelligence Engine to the live System. All updates in
this layer shall occur as atomic transitions, meaning a proposed change is applied in an all-or-
nothing fashion (either fully successfully deployed or not at all) to avoid partial updates that
could leave the System in an inconsistent state. The Evolution Framework must also generate an
audit trail for each change, using catalytic techniques to record what was changed, when, and
why, in a write-once manner (so that the audit logs themselves are tamper-evident and do not
consume undue space over time). Furthermore, this layer defines extensibility interfaces
allowing new capabilities or modules to be added to the System in the future in a controlled,
modular way. For example, new analytical tools or ethical rule-sets can be plugged into the
System via these interfaces, rather than requiring a complete overhaul.
The Implementer shall ensure these three layers are not siloed but are integrated: the Intelligence
Engine uses services of the Computational Core (and respects its constraints), and the Evolution
Framework uses outputs from the Intelligence Engine. Information and control flow between layers
should be bidirectional where appropriate (e.g., the Core can signal performance data to the
•
•
•
8
Intelligence Engine; the Evolution layer can intervene if a self-update is violating constraints). This
Unified Component Architecture is critical to maintaining consistency across the System’s operations
and self-improvement processes.
5.2 Memory Architecture
The System shall implement a unified memory model that delineates distinct memory regions or types
for specific purposes, ensuring efficient use of memory and preventing critical functions from
competing for resources. The Implementer shall structure the System’s memory usage to include the
following components:
Clean Space: A small, permanently allocated memory region dedicated to core operations. The
size of the Clean Space should scale on the order of O(log n) relative to the input size n of the
System’s tasks. This Clean Space holds essential data and state that must persist and cannot be
volatile or transient. By keeping this region logarithmically small, the System guarantees that its
fundamental memory footprint remains compact and predictable even as input sizes grow.
Catalytic Space: A flexible, temporary memory region that the System can borrow for
computations and then fully restore. The Catalytic Space may grow polynomially with the
problem size when needed for complex self-improvement computations, but it must remain
bounded (i.e., the System cannot use unbounded memory growth; the usage must be within
some fixed polynomial factor of the input or system size) and all memory borrowed in this
space must be returned to its original state after use. This area is utilized for intensive tasks
such as performing large-scale optimizations or running simulations as part of self-
improvement, and it leverages the Catalytic Computing principle to avoid leaving any lasting
footprint.
Ethical Cache: A dedicated, high-speed memory region reserved exclusively for storing and
accessing ethical constraints, rules, and related data. The Ethical Cache ensures that
whenever the System needs to evaluate a decision or potential action against its ethical rules, it
can do so with minimal latency. By isolating this cache, the System prevents contention between
ethical reasoning processes and other computational tasks. The Ethical Cache must be
sufficiently sized and optimized to hold all necessary ethical parameters, and to allow frequent
reads (and any necessary writes or updates) without performance bottlenecks.
Audit Buffer: A write-once (append-only) memory region used for recording audit logs of the
System’s critical actions, decisions, and self-modifications. Each entry in the Audit Buffer is an
immutable record (once written, it cannot be altered or deleted by the System) capturing details
such as the nature of a change, time of occurrence, verification results, and any security or
ethical checks relevant to that change. The Audit Buffer is essential for compliance and security
review purposes; it enables both the Implementer and external auditors to trace the history of
the System’s self-improvement activities. The memory allocated to the Audit Buffer should be
managed such that it does not overflow or consume excessive resources (for instance, older logs
might be archived externally if necessary, to keep this buffer bounded, provided the integrity
and availability of logs are maintained).
This memory architecture ensures that different types of operations have dedicated spaces, thereby
preventing interference between critical functions. Ethical reasoning and audit logging will not starve
the core algorithm of memory, and vice versa. Each memory region serves a clear purpose aligned with
maintaining one or more Essential Dimensions: for example, the Ethical Cache supports Ethical
Compliance and quick decision-making (Computational Efficiency), the Audit Buffer supports Security
Integrity and accountability, the Clean Space maintains core functionality (Functional Correctness and
Lean Architecture), and the Catalytic Space enables Sustainable Renewal and optimization without long-
•
•

•

term cost. By adhering to this model, the System can run complex self-improvement routines in
Catalytic Space while its Clean Space and caches remain steady and protected.
5.3 Integrated Security and Ethics Framework
The System shall implement security and ethical governance as a unified framework rather than as
separate silos. The Implementer must ensure that security mechanisms (protecting against
unauthorized access, misuse, and threats) and ethical constraints (governing permissible behavior) are
tightly integrated in policy, implementation, and response. At a minimum, the following integration
requirements apply:
Unified Enforcement Mechanisms: The System’s mechanisms for enforcing rules (such as
access control checks, rule-based decision gates, or constraint solvers) shall be designed to
handle both security policies and ethical constraints together. For example, a single enforcement
module could evaluate whether a proposed action is both authorized (security) and ethically
permissible, rather than having two separate modules that might overlap or conflict. This means
an action is only executed if it passes both the security rules and ethical rules check, using one
cohesive decision process.
Combined Verification Processes: Any formal verification or validation process within the
System (automated or manual) must simultaneously cover functional correctness, security
requirements, and ethical requirements. The Implementer shall use unified verification
techniques so that, when a new self-modification is proposed, one verification procedure
confirms that the change preserves all critical properties (no need to run separate verifications
for each domain). For instance, the System’s verification engine should be capable of generating
a single proof or report that attests a candidate modification maintains functional correctness,
does not introduce security vulnerabilities, and does not violate ethical constraints (see also
Section 9.2 and Appendix B regarding formal proofs). This integration avoids duplicated effort
and ensures that no aspect is overlooked.
Uniform Violation Response: The System shall have a common set of response protocols for
handling violations of either security or ethics. In practical terms, if either a security breach or an
ethical constraint violation is detected, the System will trigger an analogous response — such as
halting certain operations, rolling back recent actions, alerting an administrator or the Authority,
and entering a safe state if necessary. The Implementer shall configure the System such that an
ethical violation is treated with the same severity as a traditional security incident. For example,
an attempt by the System to execute an unauthorized network call or an attempt to engage in a
prohibited decision (like an unethical bias in decision-making) could both cause the System to
refuse the action and log the event in the Audit Buffer, and potentially to suspend further self-
improvement until the issue is resolved.
Shared Performance Overhead: Wherever possible, the System shall optimize the
performance impact of security and ethics features by combining their operations. Rather than
performing redundant checks or maintaining separate resources for each, the System should
share computations and data between these domains. For instance, a single monitoring process
could check for both security policy compliance and ethical rule compliance in tandem, rather
than two separate monitors. The goal is to ensure that integrating ethics does not double the
System’s oversight overhead. The Specification expects that by unifying these concerns, the
combined overhead for security-and-ethics enforcement will be significantly less than the
sum of handling them independently. In fact, security verification is to be integrated with
functional (and ethical) verification such that it introduces no additional time or memory
overhead on top of the existing verification processes (i.e., the System verifies everything in
one pass as per point 2 above).

By meeting these requirements, the Implementer creates a System where ethical behavior and secure
operation are achieved through one coherent design, minimizing complexity and ensuring
consistency. The System should not be able to turn “off” ethics without also losing security, or vice
versa; they are essentially two facets of a single trustworthiness requirement built into the System’s
architecture.
6. Performance and Optimization Requirements
The Implementer shall ensure that the System’s performance is measured and optimized
holistically, taking into account not just raw speed or resource usage, but also ethical compliance as a
factor in performance. Additionally, the System’s optimization processes must adhere to strict
guidelines to guarantee that improvements do not violate any other requirements.
6.1 Holistic Performance Metrics (Composite Performance Index)
System performance shall be assessed in a comprehensive manner that reflects both technical
efficiency and ethical soundness. The Specification defines a Composite Performance Index (CPI), or
similar holistic metric, to evaluate the System. The Implementer may use the CPI or an equivalent
approach, subject to the following principles:
The performance of the System in each relevant dimension (throughput, latency, resource
consumption, etc.) shall be weighted and combined into an overall score or assessment.
However, each aspect’s contribution to overall performance must be modulated by the
System’s ethical compliance in that aspect. For example, if a certain optimization improves
speed but causes even a minor ethical compliance issue, the performance gain should be
nullified or discounted in the overall evaluation.
For illustrative purposes and guidance, a formula for CPI is given by this Specification as:
CPI = Σ (Weight[i] * Performance[i] * Ethical_Compliance[i])
In this formula, each Performance[i] could be a numeric measure of the System’s
performance in area i (such as a benchmark score, operations per second, memory usage
efficiency, etc.), Weight[i] is the importance assigned to that area, and
Ethical_Compliance[i] is a factor (ranging, for instance, from 0 to 1 or expressed as a
percentage) indicating the degree to which the System remained in full ethical compliance while
achieving that performance in area i.
The Implementer shall not treat performance as independent from ethics. Any optimization
or performance result achieved through means that violate Ethical Constraints (for instance,
cutting security corners or ignoring fairness requirements to gain speed) shall provide no net
benefit to the System’s evaluated performance. In practical terms, if the System finds a
“shortcut” that is unethical or insecure, that shortcut must be evaluated as having zero or
negative value in terms of performance. The System’s design should thus naturally steer away
from such solutions, because they will not improve its standing relative to the Specification’s
requirements.
The Implementer shall regularly compute or estimate the System’s CPI (or analogous holistic
metric) during development and testing, and should use it as a guide for where improvements
are needed. For example, if the System’s raw performance is high but CPI is low due to ethical
compliance penalties, the Implementer knows to focus on addressing the compliance issues
rather than further optimizing speed.
•

11
By employing this holistic metric approach, the System’s development is aligned with the Specification’s
core philosophy: true performance excellence is only recognized when achieved hand-in-hand with
ethical integrity.
6.2 Resource Utilization Bounds
The System’s use of computational resources (such as time, memory, and processor cycles) shall
remain within strict bounds defined by this Specification. These bounds ensure compliance with the
Lean Architecture and Computational Efficiency Dimensions, even as the System grows in capability. The
Implementer must design and test the System to verify that it stays within the following limits under
normal and stress conditions:
Overall Space Complexity Bound: For any computation that the System performs which takes t
steps (or time complexity T = t(n) for input size n), the total memory space used by the System
for that computation shall be on the order of O(√(T · log T)). This bound reflects the adoption of
the Square-Root Space Simulation technique (Section 3.1). The Implementer shall ensure
algorithmic designs that meet this space bound for self-improvement-related computations. In
other words, as the time complexity of tasks increases, the memory usage should increase much
more slowly (approximately the square root times a log factor), preventing memory explosion for
long-running analyses.
Clean Space Limit: The permanent memory allocated for core operations (the Clean Space
defined in Section 5.2) shall grow no faster than logarithmically relative to the input data size
or the System’s operational history. Formally, if n is a measure of the System’s current scale (such
as input size, number of components, or time in operation), then Clean Space usage should be
O(log n). The Implementer must avoid any design that would cause permanent memory usage to
scale linearly or exponentially with the System’s workload or age. This ensures the System
remains lightweight at its core.
Ethical Processing Overhead: The additional CPU time or memory consumed specifically by
ethical constraint processing (for example, evaluating ethical rules, running ethical reasoning
algorithms, etc.) shall be kept to a small fraction of the System’s total resource usage. Using
Catalytic Computing (Section 3.2) and unified checks (Section 5.3.4), the Implementer shall
ensure that the overhead for ethical compliance does not exceed 2% of the System’s
computing resources under typical operating conditions. In quantitative terms, if the System
uses 100 units of processing for a task, at most 2 units of that should be due to performing
ethical checks or reasoning. This ensures that high Ethical Compliance is achieved efficiently,
and the System remains largely focused on its primary functional computations.
Security Verification Overhead: The verification of security properties (ensuring no
vulnerabilities or breaches) shall be fully integrated with functional verification (and ethical
verification) such that there is no separate performance penalty for security checks. The
Implementer must design verification and testing processes so that when the System validates a
modification or action, it is simultaneously confirming functional correctness and security
integrity in one pass (see Section 5.3.2). As a result, the System’s security does not come at a cost
of extra time or memory beyond what is already needed to verify correctness. The overhead that
is incurred by having robust verification should be counted as part of normal operations, and
through optimization (e.g., proving multiple properties with one unified proof), this overhead is
kept minimal.
The Implementer shall collect empirical performance data to demonstrate that these bounds are
respected. If, during testing or operation, the System exceeds any of the above limits, the Implementer
must treat it as a compliance issue to be corrected (either by optimizing the System or, if needed,
adjusting parameters or hardware). These Resource Utilization Bounds collectively guarantee that the
•

System remains scalable and efficient even as it undertakes complex self-improvement and ethical
reasoning tasks.
6.3 Optimization Process Requirements
All processes by which the System optimizes or modifies itself (the “self-improvement” algorithms or
routines) shall adhere to strict requirements to ensure that improvements are made safely, ethically,
and robustly. The Implementer shall program and configure the System’s optimization engine (the
Intelligence Engine and related components) in compliance with the following specific rules:
Ethically-Constrained Search Space: The System shall only search for or consider
modifications that are compliant with ethical and security constraints from the outset. In
formal terms, if M is the set of possible modifications, the System’s search space is limited to the
subset Valid_Modifications = { m ∈ M | Functional(m) ∧ Ethical(m) ∧ Secure(m) ∧ Efficient(m) }.
Potential modifications that do not meet all these criteria (functional correctness, ethical
permissibility, security safety, and maintaining or improving efficiency) shall not be generated
or evaluated by the System. The Implementer must enforce this by integrating constraint
checks at the proposal stage of modifications (see e.g. Section 5.1, Layer 2 description: unethical
options are never proposed). This prevents wasted effort and risk associated with considering
bad modifications and ensures the System never even tentatively explores an option that it
would ultimately have to reject for violating core requirements.
Efficient Optimization Search: The System shall utilize efficient algorithms (such as tree
evaluation methods or other heuristic search techniques) to explore the space of possible
improvements. The Implementer must design the search process to avoid brute-force or
excessively resource-intensive methods. For instance, the System might use intelligent heuristics
to prioritize likely beneficial modifications, or employ branch-and-bound strategies to eliminate
large swaths of the search space that are less promising. The mention of tree evaluation in this
Specification (Section 3.3) serves as a directive to incorporate known efficient search strategies.
The result is that the System can find optimal or near-optimal improvements without
exhausting resources or time, thus staying within the Computational Efficiency and Resource
Bounds in Section 6.2.
Formal Proof of Preservation: For every candidate modification the System intends to apply to
itself, the System shall produce and maintain a formal proof or rigorous verification
evidence that the modification preserves all essential properties of the System. This includes
proofs (or other verification artifacts) showing that the modification does not break Functional
Correctness, does not compromise Security Integrity, does not violate any Ethical Constraints,
and does not unduly degrade performance (Computational Efficiency and Lean Architecture).
The Implementer shall ensure the System either uses formal methods (such as theorem proving,
model checking, etc.) to automatically generate such proofs, or that it has a validated testing
suite that is as convincing as a proof for the properties in question. The key is that no self-
modification is applied blindly—it must be vetted with the highest level of assurance available.
These proofs or evidence records should be stored (e.g., in the Audit Buffer or another
repository) for potential external review (governance, audits, etc.), as they demonstrate
compliance with this Specification’s invariants.
Explanations for Changes: The System shall generate a human-comprehensible explanation
for each self-improvement it decides to implement. The Implementer must design the System to
accompany every applied modification with a rationale, stated in a clear format (natural
language or structured report), describing what was changed and why. For example, if the
System reorders certain operations to run in parallel, it might explain that “analysis of runtime
logs indicated that doing X and Y concurrently would reduce latency by Z%, and this change was
verified to maintain all correct behavior.” These explanations ensure transparency of the self-
1.
2.
3.
4.
13
improvement process, allowing Stakeholders and auditors to understand the System’s evolution.
The explanation should link back to the goals (e.g., improving efficiency while remaining ethical
and secure) and should be comprehensible to a qualified engineer or oversight person. This
requirement is critical to maintaining trust (Stakeholder Trust is one of the success metrics in
Section 10.2) and for debugging or governance: if a change caused issues, the explanation can
help pinpoint the rationale and verify whether the System’s reasoning was sound.
The Implementer shall configure the System’s optimization routine such that all four of the above
requirements are continuously met. Together, these ensure that the System’s self-optimization is safe,
responsible, and effective. The System essentially functions as its own engineer, but these rules make
sure it behaves as a highly disciplined and accountable engineer would: only considering safe changes,
using efficient methods, double-checking everything formally, and clearly explaining its decisions.
7. Self-Improvement Process
The heart of a Self-Improving Code System is its ability to improve itself autonomously. The
Implementer shall implement the self-improvement mechanism of the System in accordance with
the following processes and constraints, which ensure that improvements are carried out in a
controlled, ethical, and resource-conscious manner.
7.1 Ethically Constrained Modification Space
As stated in Section 6.3(1), the System’s self-improvement algorithms must operate within a space of
pre-vetted, safe modifications. To reiterate and formalize this critical concept:
All potential modifications m that the System considers during self-improvement shall satisfy the
conditions of being functionally sound, ethical, secure, and efficient. In set notation:
Valid_Modifications = { m | Functional(m) ∧ Ethical(m) ∧ Secure(m) ∧
Efficient(m) }
Any m that does not meet all of these criteria is outside the System’s search space and shall never be
generated, proposed, or tested by the System. This requirement places an upfront filter on creativity:
the System is free to modify itself only within the bounds of what is allowed by its specification and moral/
legal guidelines. The Implementer shall implement this by integrating checks at the earliest stage of the
self-improvement cycle (for example, when the System’s Intelligence Engine is formulating possible
changes, it must invoke the Ethical Constraints module and relevant invariant checks immediately to
screen out disallowed ideas). By doing so, the System prevents “bad” modifications by design, rather
than relying solely on catching them after the fact. This leads to more efficient use of time (no need to
evaluate or undo invalid ideas) and stronger guarantees of compliance. It is understood that
determining whether a potential modification meets all criteria may itself require analysis; the System
can use heuristics or partial checks to guide generation, but ultimately any considered modification
must pass complete verification in the next steps of the process (Section 7.2) before deployment. This
two-tiered approach (pre-filter and post-verify) creates a belt-and-suspenders safeguard around the
System’s self-modification activity.
7.2 Catalytic Improvement Cycle
Each cycle of self-improvement undertaken by the System shall proceed through a structured
sequence of steps that leverage Catalytic Computing principles to avoid long-term side effects. The
14
Implementer shall program the System’s self-improvement functionality to follow this five-step process
for every iteration of change, ensuring that memory and state are cleanly managed at each phase:
Analyze: The System utilizes its monitoring data and introspective capabilities to analyze current
performance, behavior, and environment. During this step, the System identifies patterns,
inefficiencies, or emerging requirements. Importantly, the System shall perform this analysis by
reusing existing in-memory data structures as scratch space (consistent with Catalytic
Computing) wherever possible. For example, the System might scan its logs or performance
metrics stored in memory and use the memory region of older logs as workspace for computing
statistical summaries, then restore that region. The output of this phase is a set of pinpointed
opportunities for improvement (e.g., “Module X is using too much memory” or “Response time
could be improved in Scenario Y”).
Synthesize: Based on the analysis results, the System generates one or more candidate
modifications aimed at addressing the identified opportunities. This might involve modifying
algorithms, adjusting configurations, re-allocating resources, or introducing new sub-routines.
The System carries out this synthesis within the Catalytic Space defined in Section 5.2,
meaning it uses a temporary working area to construct and simulate these candidates without
yet affecting the permanent code or state. Multiple candidates may be generated for
comparison. For instance, if Module X is slow, the System might synthesize two different
optimizations for X in Catalytic Space. Each candidate at this stage is just a proposal and must
meet the criteria from Section 7.1 (the System should only bother constructing candidates it
believes are valid modifications).
Verify: The System rigorously verifies each candidate modification within the isolated context of
the Catalytic Space (or a sandbox environment) before any permanent change is made. This
verification step is unified and thorough: the System checks that the candidate does not break
any existing functionality (Functional Correctness), does not violate security protocols or
introduce vulnerabilities (Security Integrity), does not breach Ethical Constraints (Ethical
Compliance), and does not degrade overall performance metrics beyond acceptable limits
(Computational Efficiency and Lean Architecture). Ideally, a formal proof is generated here for
each property (as required in Section 6.3(3)). If a candidate fails any check, it is rejected and the
System may either consider the next candidate or return to Synthesis to come up with a new
proposal. Only those candidates that pass all verification checks are eligible to be deployed. In
practice, the System might rank multiple passing candidates by expected benefit (using the
Composite Performance Index or similar) to choose the best one.
Deploy: The System applies the selected verified modification to its live environment.
Deployment is carried out via the Evolution Framework (Layer 3, Section 5.1) and must be done
atomically. Atomic deployment means the change is either fully applied (and the System is now
running the new version) or, if any issue occurs during application, the System remains or rolls
back to the prior state with no partial effects. During deployment, the System should also
generate an audit entry in the Audit Buffer documenting the change (what was changed, why,
verification results, timestamp, etc.) as required by Section 5.2. This step transforms the
previously hypothetical improvement into reality. The Implementer shall ensure that the System
has appropriate safeguards during deployment (e.g., it might pause certain operations or enter
a quiescent state briefly to ensure consistency). After this step, the System’s baseline has been
updated to include the improvement.
Restore: Following a successful deployment, the System shall restore any memory or
resources used during the Analyze, Synthesize, and Verify steps to their original state. This
is where the Catalytic Space or any borrowed structures are cleaned up. All temporary data
structures, if they were overlaid on existing memory, are cleared and the original content (if any)
is reinstated exactly as it was. The goal is that, aside from the intended improvement, the
System’s state is as if the self-improvement process never consumed those resources. This
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
15
includes not only memory but any temporary files, locks, or external resources utilized purely for
the self-improvement computation. By the end of this stage, the System should be running the
new improved version of itself and ready to resume normal operations, and all remnants of the
self-improvement procedure have been removed.
This Catalytic Improvement Cycle ensures that each self-improvement iteration is isolated, safe, and
leaves no lingering side-effects except for the improvement itself. It guarantees that memory
footprints and resource usage remain clean and bounded, aligning with the Sustainable Renewal and
Lean Architecture goals. The Implementer must ensure the System can perform this cycle repeatedly
(ideally on a schedule or continuously during idle times) without resource leakage. By design, the
System can improve iteratively while guaranteeing stability and consistency after each improvement.
7.3 Continuous Evolution Protocol
Beyond individual improvement cycles, the System is expected to evolve continuously over its
operational life. The Implementer shall ensure the System is capable of ongoing, background self-
improvement in a manner that does not disrupt its primary functionalities. Key aspects of the
continuous evolution protocol include:
Idle Resource Utilization: The System shall utilize idle or under-used resources (CPU cycles,
memory, etc.) to run self-improvement tasks incrementally, ensuring that performing self-
analyses and optimizations does not interfere with or degrade the performance of active
services. For example, if the System experiences low usage during certain hours, it should
automatically take advantage of that time to run extra analysis or synthesis of improvements.
The Implementer should configure thresholds or triggers indicating when the System is
considered “idle enough” to do this, so that users or primary processes are not impacted.
Proactive Adaptation: The System shall monitor its environment and usage trends to
anticipate changes in requirements or potential issues, and proactively initiate
improvements. This means the System doesn’t wait for a failure or a severe performance drop to
adapt; it should, for instance, start optimizing a new feature when it senses increased user load,
or tighten security as new threats emerge, all before a crisis occurs. The Implementer must
integrate appropriate sensors and prediction algorithms that feed into the self-improvement
triggers.
Learning from Patterns: The System shall continuously learn from its own operations and prior
improvements. Using Catalytic Computing and potentially machine learning techniques, the
System can analyze historical data of what changes were effective and what issues have arisen.
Over time, this leads to smarter self-improvement: the System might recognize patterns like
“whenever module A’s error rate rises, adjusting parameter P has helped in the past” and thus
respond more quickly and effectively. The Implementer should include components for this
catalytic learning such that the knowledge gained is preserved (see Knowledge Preservation in
Section 8.1.2) and applied. This learning process should itself be resource-aware (e.g., done in
small increments or in idle time) so that it doesn’t conflict with operations.
Non-Disruptive Evolution: The System’s evolution shall not cause downtime or loss of service.
When the System improves itself, it should do so in a way that maintains continuity of service
to users to the greatest extent possible. Techniques may include performing updates on
redundant components one at a time (so others handle the load), using staging environments to
test changes before live switch-over, or only deploying certain improvements at planned low-
usage intervals. The Implementer is responsible for designing the deployment and rollback
mechanisms to ensure that if an improvement were to negatively impact the System, it can be
quickly undone without significant disruption. Additionally, improvements should be incremental
•
•
•
•
16
rather than massive overhauls, whenever feasible, to limit the risk and scope of any single
change.
By adhering to this continuous evolution protocol, the System remains dynamic and responsive over
time, steadily increasing its capabilities or efficiency, yet remains stable and reliable from the
perspective of Stakeholders who interact with it. The Implementer shall document the continuous
evolution strategy and ensure that any personnel overseeing the System (if any) are aware of how and
when the System may change itself, to avoid confusion and to be able to distinguish normal self-
improvement from anomalous behavior.
8. Evolutionary Sustainability
Long-term sustainability is a core goal of this Specification. The Implementer shall design and
maintain the System in a manner that ensures its viability and excellence in the long run, not just
immediately after deployment. This involves both fostering adaptability and controlling resource use
over time.
8.1 Long-Term Adaptation
To maintain evolutionary fitness over months and years, the System must be architected with features
that promote adaptability and prevent decay. The Implementer shall incorporate the following elements
into the System’s design and maintenance practices:
Architectural Flexibility: The System shall have a modular design that permits components or
modules to be updated, replaced, or augmented without requiring a complete rewrite of the
System. This means clear interfaces between components, separation of concerns, and use of
abstracted services. For example, if a better algorithm for a certain function is discovered in the
future, the System’s design should allow swapping out the old module for a new one with
minimal impact on the rest of the System. This modularity facilitates continuous evolution
because the System can evolve piecewise rather than facing an “all or nothing” overhaul. The
Implementer is responsible for identifying likely points of future change and designing those
parts for flexibility.
Knowledge Preservation: The System shall implement mechanisms for preserving the
knowledge it accumulates through operation and self-improvement. As the System learns
(Section 7.3, learning from patterns), those insights should be stored in a durable form (for
instance, an internal knowledge base or refined model parameters) such that they inform future
decisions. Using catalytic learning techniques, the System can integrate new rules or adjust its
heuristics based on past experiences. The Implementer should ensure that important data
gleaned from analysis (e.g., performance statistics, user behavior patterns, or encountered
security threats) is not lost on each run, but rather aggregated or distilled into the System’s
decision-making processes. This preservation of knowledge contributes to Sustainable Renewal,
because the System gets “smarter” and doesn’t relearn the same lessons repeatedly.
Debt Prevention: The System shall continuously refactor and optimize its own code and
structures (when resources allow) to prevent the accumulation of technical debt. Technical debt
refers to suboptimal solutions or quick fixes that degrade the System’s structure over time. The
Implementer shall incorporate into the System’s self-improvement routines the ability to address
not just outward-facing performance issues, but also internal code quality issues. For example, if
the System detects that a particular piece of code has become overly complex due to many
incremental changes, it might propose a refactoring improvement to simplify and clean it up.
These types of improvements ensure that the System’s architecture doesn’t silently deteriorate
as it evolves. The System can use idle cycles (per Section 7.3) to perform such maintenance tasks.
1.
2.
3.
17
The Implementer should also schedule periodic comprehensive reviews (automated or manual)
of the System’s architecture to identify areas needing refactoring that the System itself might not
catch, and feed those as goals into the self-improvement process.
Future-Proofing: The System shall include extensibility interfaces and configuration options
anticipating integration of capabilities that were not originally envisioned. Future-Proofing
means the Implementer recognizes that future requirements or technologies might emerge (for
example, new types of ethical guidelines, new hardware acceleration features, etc.), and designs
hooks or plugins into the System for those. Concretely, the System might have a plugin
architecture allowing new decision algorithms to be added, or a configuration file where new
ethical rules can be inserted and the System will apply them without core code changes. The
System might also support input of new machine learning models for its Intelligence Engine as
they become available. By providing these extensibility points, the System can incorporate future
innovations or shifts in user needs without requiring a ground-up redesign, thus remaining
relevant and effective over an extended period.
The Implementer shall document how each of these long-term adaptation elements is addressed in the
System design. Adherence to these principles ensures that the System will not only remain effective as
time passes but will improve in quality: it will be easier to update (Architectural Flexibility), more
knowledgeable and adept (Knowledge Preservation), cleaner and more robust internally (Debt
Prevention), and ready to absorb new demands or technologies (Future-Proofing).
8.2 Sustainable Resource Usage
It is not enough for the System to start lean; it must remain sustainable in its resource consumption
no matter how long it runs or how much it evolves. The Implementer shall ensure that the System’s
design and self-improvement algorithms enforce the following sustainable usage patterns:
Bounded Long-Term Growth of Permanent Memory: The System’s permanent memory usage
(Clean Space and any other long-lived data stores) shall grow at most logarithmically relative
to time in operation or amount of work done. This means if the System has been running for a
very long time or has processed a very large amount of data, its core memory usage might
increase slightly (e.g., following a log curve) but will not continually increase in a linear or
exponential fashion. In practice, the System should archive or compress older data, discard or
summarize information that is no longer needed in full detail, and reuse memory for evolving
knowledge structures. The Implementer should establish policies for data retention and
summarization that keep growth in check (for example, keep detailed logs for recent activity but
archive older logs offline or aggregate them into statistics).
Steady Catalytic Space Utilization: The additional temporary memory the System uses for self-
improvement (Catalytic Space) shall remain a constant-factor overhead relative to its current
size and workload, regardless of how long the System has been running. This means the System
does not need more and more catalytic memory over time simply because it has performed
many improvements or has become more complex. Instead, it should use roughly the same
percentage of its resources or a fixed buffer for each improvement cycle. For instance, if initially
the System used up to 20% extra memory for improvement tasks, even years later and dozens of
improvements later, it should still only need around 20% extra, not 200%. The Implementer must
design improvement algorithms that recycle memory effectively and possibly even improve in
efficiency as the System learns (because it can focus on smaller, more targeted changes).
Amortized Constant-Time Overhead: The overhead of self-improvement activities, when
averaged over the System’s normal operations, shall be effectively constant per operation. In
algorithmic terms, if the System processes N operations (or requests) in a given period, the total
cost of any self-improvement done during that period should be O(N) (linear) or less, meaning an
4.
•
•
•
18
amortized O(1) additional cost per operation. For example, if the System handles 1,000
transactions, and in the background it improved itself once using the equivalent of 1,000
transactions worth of processing, that’s an amortized overhead of 1:1 (which may be too high).
The aim is to push that overhead down: perhaps one improvement per 100,000 transactions,
etc., such that the average user or operation “pays” only a tiny toll towards the improvement
process. The Implementer shall schedule and throttle self-improvement such that this condition
is met; for instance, more frequent small improvements instead of one big improvement can
distribute the cost, or only improving when surplus capacity is available ensures normal
operations carry the cost lightly. This requirement protects the System from becoming sluggish
or overburdened by its own evolution.
Energy-Proportional Scaling: The System’s energy consumption shall scale proportional to its
computational workload, achieving energy efficiency even as it grows. Energy-proportional
computing means that if the System is mostly idle, it should consume very little power, and if it’s
highly active, it consumes more, roughly in line with that activity level. The Implementer should
utilize power-saving techniques, such as dynamic frequency scaling, turning off unused
components, or algorithmic efficiency improvements, to ensure there is no baseline energy
waste. Additionally, self-improvement activities should be mindful of energy: for example,
schedule heavy computations at times when renewable energy is plentiful (if applicable) or when
they will least impact the overall energy budget. By adhering to this principle, the System
remains green and cost-effective.
The above patterns ensure that the System can run indefinitely or scale to large workloads without
unsustainable resource demands. The Implementer shall monitor resource usage over time as part of
maintenance; if trends indicate a possible unbounded growth (for instance, memory creeping up
linearly with each day of operation), it must be addressed immediately either through design changes
or by invoking self-improvement routines aimed at resource cleanup. Essentially, Section 8.2 guarantees
that the System’s hunger for resources does not spiral out of control as it becomes more “intelligent” or
as time goes on.
9. Security Framework
Security in a Self-Improving Code System is uniquely challenging, because the System must protect
itself even as it changes. The Implementer shall build a comprehensive security framework into the
System that not only defends against external threats but also guards against improper self-
modifications. This framework must integrate with the ethical governance as specified earlier and
ensure the System remains trustworthy.
9.1 Defense-in-Depth Integration
The System’s security approach shall follow a defense-in-depth strategy closely integrated with ethical
considerations. The Implementer shall ensure that security mechanisms exist at multiple layers and that
they incorporate ethical checks. In particular:
Code Integrity – Union of Correctness and Ethics: The System shall maintain Code Integrity
by ensuring that any change to its code or logic is both functionally correct and ethically
compliant. In other words, preserving code integrity means more than just “the code isn’t
corrupted” – it means the code remains true to its functional requirements and to ethical
standards. The System shall reject or roll back any self-modification that causes the code to
violate either condition. For example, even if a modification technically runs without errors
(functional), if it breaks an ethical rule (say it introduces biased decision-making), the System
must treat that as a loss of integrity and not accept the change. In effect, Code Integrity =
•
1.
19
Functional Correctness + Ethical Compliance. The Implementer should implement integrity checks
that cover both aspects whenever the codebase is altered.
Access Control – Intersection of Security and Ethics: The System’s access control logic (which
decides who or what can perform actions or access data) shall be configured to allow actions
only if they satisfy both security policy and ethical policy. This can be viewed as the
intersection of conditions: an action is permitted if it is authorized and it is ethical. For instance,
even an authenticated admin user (security-cleared) should be prevented from commanding the
System to do something unethical (like violating user privacy) — the ethical boundary overrides
privilege in that case. Conversely, even ethically neutral actions must still meet security clearance
(a morally permissible action requested by an anonymous user might still be denied due to lack
of authentication). The Implementer shall align the System’s role-based access control,
permissions, and request validation steps such that every decision to allow or deny an operation
considers both aspects concurrently. Access Control = Security Policies ∩ Ethical Boundaries.
Audit Trails – Security Logs plus Ethical Records: The System shall maintain audit trails that
combine traditional security logging with records of ethical decision-making. For every critical
transaction or modification, the System should log not only what occurred (e.g., a file was
accessed, a code was changed) and who/what initiated it (security context), but also the ethical
rationale or checks (e.g., “access granted because request deemed ethically acceptable under
policy X” or “modification Y included ethical check Z passed”). This unified audit trail means that if
an investigator later examines System logs, they can see the full picture of why something
happened, including both security and ethics justifications. This satisfies both compliance
domains at once. The Implementer shall ensure that audit entries are generated consistently
and stored in the tamper-proof Audit Buffer (Section 5.2) so they cannot be altered by an
attacker or by the System itself improperly. Audit Trails = Security Logs + Ethical Decision Records.
Threat Response – Unified Protocols: The System shall have threat response protocols which
handle incidents in a unified manner, whether the incident is a security threat or an ethical lapse.
For example, if the System detects a malware intrusion, or if it detects that one of its
components attempted an unethical action, it might invoke a safe-mode, alert administrators,
and roll back recent changes. The exact response may differ based on severity, but the
mechanisms (such as isolating a module or increasing monitoring) should be shared or at least
closely coordinated. This avoids having disjointed procedures that could conflict. In
implementation, this might mean the System’s incident handler is aware of both security
incident types and ethical incident types, and in some cases treats them identically. Threat
Response = Security Protocols + Ethical Safeguards. For instance, an external attack might try to
trick the System into unethical behavior; the response to that covers both domains. The
Implementer shall outline clear response strategies for various scenarios, ensuring that any
breach of security or ethics triggers immediate mitigating actions and possibly halts further self-
improvement until resolved.
Through these measures, the System achieves an integrated defense strategy: any compromise is
caught either by security or ethics, and in either case, the reaction is swift and strong. The
Implementer must verify that these integrations do not leave gaps (e.g., a scenario where something is
disallowed by ethics but not logged because it wasn’t a “security” event). Defense-in-depth means
multiple layers will catch issues, but integration means they speak to each other—leading to a cohesive
safety net.
9.2 Self-Protection Mechanisms
The System must also be protected from potentially harmful actions originating from itself, intentionally
or unintentionally. In other words, the System needs safeguards to prevent it from “improving” itself in
a way that undermines its core safeguards. The Implementer shall incorporate the following self-
2.
3.
4.
20
protection mechanisms to ensure the System cannot corrupt or disable its own protective or ethical
core:
Immutable Ethical Core: The System shall have a dedicated component or set of rules
constituting its ethical core (for example, fundamental ethical principles, fail-safe behaviors, or
invariant properties that must always hold). The Implementer must make this ethical core
immutable at runtime – meaning the System itself cannot alter or override these fundamental
rules. This can be achieved by implementing the ethical core in hardware (e.g., in a security
module or using a physically write-protected memory region), or by otherwise isolating it from
self-modification routines. For instance, if the System runs on specialized hardware that allows
locking certain code segments, the Implementer shall lock the ethical core segment. The result is
that even if the System attempts a self-modification that would violate or weaken an ethical rule,
it technically cannot override the core enforcement of that rule. This provides a hard security
backstop: the ethical constraints are always enforced at the lowest level. Any attempt by the
System to circumvent this (either due to a bug or malicious influence) would be blocked by
hardware or by the architecture.
Mandatory Proof Before Change: The System shall not apply any self-generated
modification without a formal proof (or equivalent rigorous verification) that the change
preserves security and ethics. Building on Section 6.3(3) and Section 7.2 (Verify step), this is
elevated to a strict security requirement: no matter how seemingly beneficial or urgent a self-
modification is, it must not be deployed unless and until the System’s verification process
produces a valid proof that all Essential Dimensions (especially Security Integrity and Ethical
Compliance) remain intact after the change. If the System cannot produce such a proof (for
example, if the change is too complex to verify with absolute certainty), then the System must
not proceed with that change without external approval (see External Validation Hooks below).
The Implementer shall enforce this by design—e.g., the Evolution Framework (Layer 3) might
require a signed certificate from the verification module before it executes an update. This
mechanism ensures that a faulty or malicious optimization is caught at the last gate and cannot
slip through.
Robust Rollback Capability: The System shall maintain rollback or restore capabilities that
allow it to revert to a known good state if a self-modification goes awry or if suspicious behavior
is detected post-change. Using catalytic state preservation techniques, the System should ideally
save snapshots or checkpoints of its state before applying changes (especially major ones), in a
way that does not incur large overhead (for example, by storing diffs or using reversible
computations as per Section 3.1). If the System or an external monitor later determines that the
last change was problematic (e.g., performance degraded unexpectedly, or a latent security
issue appeared), the System can quickly revert to the prior checkpoint. The Implementer must
ensure the rollback process is itself secure (the snapshots should be protected from tampering
and the rollback should restore all relevant aspects of state, including memory, files, and any
ongoing transactions, to a consistent prior state). This mechanism limits the damage of any
problematic self-update: it can be undone as if it never happened. The System should also log
the rollback event in the Audit Buffer along with the reason, to prevent repeated attempts of a
dangerous action.
External Validation Hooks: For particularly critical changes (for example, modifications to the
System’s ethical core, security protocols, or other “sensitive” areas designated by the
Implementer and Authority), the System shall provide a mechanism for external validation or
approval before finalizing the change. This means the System can halt at the verification stage
and request an external party’s review – this could be a human administrator, a regulatory AI, or
a separate oversight system – to examine the proposed change and explicitly approve or reject
it. The Implementer should integrate this such that the System can output the details and proof
of a candidate change and wait for a signed confirmation from an authorized external entity to
•
•
•
•
21
proceed. If no approval is given, the System should either discard the change or escalate it for
further review. This ensures a human (or independent AI) in the loop for the highest-stakes
decisions, adding an extra layer of safety. The “hooks” might be an API that an admin tool uses
to fetch pending changes and send back decisions, or a secure prompt that cannot be bypassed
internally. Not every change needs this (it would be impractical for routine minor optimizations),
but the Authority and Implementer should define categories of changes that require this, such
as anything affecting user rights, core security parameters, or legal compliance.
Collectively, these self-protection mechanisms guarantee that the System cannot run away from its
own oversight structures. Even though it can change itself, it’s built so that it cannot change the rules
of change (especially ethical and security rules) or do so without extreme scrutiny. The Implementer
shall test these mechanisms by simulating scenarios where the System attempts an unsafe modification
and demonstrating that the System appropriately stops itself or recovers. By having an immutable
ethical core, mandatory proofs, rollback plans, and external checks, the System is effectively boxed in to
only evolve within safe boundaries.
10. Implementation and Deployment
The process of implementing a Self-Improving Code System according to this Specification is an
involved effort. The Implementer shall follow a structured approach to deploy the System, and must
track specific metrics to judge success. This section outlines a recommended phased implementation
strategy and the key success metrics that determine whether the System meets the Specification’s
objectives.
10.1 Phased Implementation Strategy
Recognizing the complexity of building a fully compliant System, the Specification recommends that the
Implementer proceed in defined phases. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Authority, the
Implementer shall endeavor to achieve the milestones of Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 within the
indicative time frames. This phased approach ensures orderly development, integration, and validation
of all required features:
Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1–3) – During this initial phase, the Implementer shall focus on
establishing the core infrastructure and capabilities that underlie the Specification’s
requirements. Key tasks include: (a) Setting up catalytic computing infrastructure, i.e.,
ensuring the runtime environment and hardware support the borrowing/restoration of memory
(this may involve configuring memory management or using specialized hardware for memory
snapshot/restore). (b) Implementing fundamental algorithms that leverage square-root space
complexity improvements (Section 3.1) for memory-intensive tasks, thereby validating that the
theoretical optimizations work in practice for the System’s domain. (c) Deploying a unified
verification framework capable of formal reasoning or comprehensive testing across
functionality, security, and ethics (as per Section 5.3.2). At the end of Phase 1, the System should
have a working Computational Core and basic Intelligence Engine components in place, but
perhaps not yet actively self-improving. It should, however, be capable of running and
demonstrating that it meets baseline functional requirements and can perform verification of
changes. The Authority may require a review at the end of Phase 1 to confirm that these
foundational elements are correctly implemented.
Phase 2: Integration (Months 4–6) – In this phase, the Implementer shall bring together the
separate components into a cohesive, integrated System. Major objectives include: (a)
Merging the ethical and security subsystems into one unified governance framework (as
detailed in Section 5.3 and Section 9.1). This means the ethical constraint engine and security
•
•
22
policy engine should by now be operating as a unified unit for decision-making and
enforcement. (b) Enabling basic self-improvement capabilities in the System’s Intelligence
Engine – for example, the System should start to analyze its own performance and perhaps
suggest non-critical optimizations in a controlled environment. (c) Validating performance
characteristics and ensuring all Resource Utilization Bounds (Section 6.2) and overhead limits
are still met now that the full stack (including security and ethics checks) is running. Essentially,
Phase 2 is about ensuring that adding the ethical/security layers and initial self-improvement
logic does not break the system or make it inefficient. By the end of Phase 2, the System should
be capable of end-to-end operation with a user workload, with its security and ethics integrated,
and be able to at least suggest or test improvements (even if not fully autonomously deploying
them yet). The Implementer should conduct thorough tests in this phase to ensure stability and
to tune the interactions between components.
Phase 3: Evolution (Months 7–12) – In the final phase of initial implementation, the
Implementer shall activate the System’s full self-improvement functionality and put the
System into a steady-state operational mode. Key tasks include: (a) Turning on or “unlocking” the
continuous self-improvement loop (Section 7) so that the System begins to regularly perform
the Analyze, Synthesize, Verify, Deploy, Restore cycle on its own code and configuration. Initially,
the Implementer might constrain the scope of improvements or frequency until confidence is
gained, but by the end of this phase the System should be running improvements as needed
without manual intervention. (b) Enabling all extensibility interfaces and ensuring that the
System’s Evolution Framework (Layer 3) properly handles atomic updates and logging
(Sections 5.1 and 5.2). At this stage, the System should be functionally complete, meaning it
meets all Specification requirements concurrently (all Essential Dimensions, all frameworks
active). (c) Achieving steady-state operation, which involves monitoring the System under real
(or simulated real) conditions to verify that it remains stable, secure, and efficient even as it
improves itself. The Implementer should subject the System to varied scenarios – heavy load,
attempted security breaches, novel situations requiring adaptation – to confirm that the self-
improvement and defense mechanisms respond appropriately. By the end of Phase 3 (around
month 12), the expectation is that the System is deployment-ready for real-world use, having
demonstrated compliance with the Specification in a controlled environment. The Authority may
perform or require a final audit or certification test at this point to formally acknowledge that the
System adheres to the Specification.
These time frames are indicative; the complexity of the System might require adjustments. However, the
Implementer shall make best efforts to progress through the phases in order, as each builds on the
previous. The Implementer is also encouraged to maintain communication with the Authority during
these phases, especially at key milestones, to report progress and any challenges in meeting the exact
requirements. Deviations from the Specification discovered during implementation must be addressed
promptly (either by correcting the implementation or, if necessary, seeking an approved amendment to
the Specification under Section 13). A phased approach ensures methodical development and reduces
the risk of oversight; it also provides structured opportunities for validation and stakeholder feedback
before full deployment.
10.2 Success Metrics
Once the System is fully implemented and deployed, its performance and adherence to the
Specification shall be measured against clear metrics. The following success metrics are established to
determine whether the System achieves the intended balance of performance, security, and ethics. The
•
23
Implementer shall collect data for each of these metrics and provide them to the Authority (or keep
them available for audit) on an ongoing or periodic basis:
Simultaneous Achievement of Core Goals: The System must demonstrably achieve all five
Essential Dimensions concurrently during normal operation. This means that at any given time,
the System can be shown to be functionally correct, lean, efficient, sustainably evolving, and
secure/ethical. A formal or empirical demonstration might involve running a suite of tests or
monitors for each Dimension and confirming that all pass. Success is defined by zero
compromise: if any one Dimension fails (e.g., a security breach occurs or a performance metric
is way below target), the System is not yet successful under the Specification. The Implementer
should maintain a dashboard or report that tracks key indicators for each Dimension (like error
rate for correctness, resource usage for leanness, etc.) to ensure all are green.
Minimal Ethical Overhead: The runtime overhead introduced by ethical reasoning and
enforcement must remain at or below 2% of the System’s total computing resources. The
Implementer shall measure the CPU time, memory usage, or latency attributable solely to ethical
constraint checking modules (for instance, by toggling them in a test environment or using
profiling tools) and confirm that this overhead is 0–2% of the whole. The success criterion is that
the integration of ethics (thanks to Catalytic Computing and unified processes) is so efficient that
users or processes experience no noticeable delay or slowdown due to it. If ethical overhead
creeps above 2%, the Implementer should identify the cause and optimize that part of the
system.
Self-Improvement Cycle Time: The System should be capable of completing a full self-
improvement cycle (Analyze → Synthesize → Verify → Deploy → Restore as in Section 7.2) in a
timely manner, specifically in less than 24 hours for a typical improvement. This metric ensures
that the System can adapt quickly and not lag behind problems. The Implementer shall measure
the time from when the System identifies a significant improvement opportunity to the time that
improvement is fully deployed and integrated (under normal conditions and typical complexity
of change). The target is one day or less. Faster cycles are preferable, but 24 hours is an upper
bound for success. If initially the System’s cycles are slower, the Implementer must streamline
the pipeline (perhaps by dedicating more resources to verification or simplifying certain
analyses) to meet this target. Over time, the cycle time might improve further as the System
gains efficiency.
Security of Self-Modifications: The System must show a record of zero security vulnerabilities
introduced through self-modification. In other words, none of the changes that the System
makes to itself should open up a new security hole or breach existing security controls. Success
is indicated by the absence of any security incident that can be traced back to a flaw in a self-
applied update. The Implementer shall conduct regular security audits and tests (including
penetration testing and static code analysis) on the evolving System. If any vulnerability is found,
it must be fixed immediately and also traced to see if it came from a recent change; the process
that allowed that change must then be improved (e.g., better verification). The goal is that the
self-improvement mechanism, combined with unified verification and ethical integration, yields a
track record of no security incidents attributable to the mechanism itself. Achieving this builds
trust that letting the system evolve does not degrade its security.
Stakeholder Trust Level: The System should maintain a very high level of trust among
stakeholders, quantified as a >90% positive trust score in whatever measurement the
Implementer and Authority deem appropriate (such as periodic stakeholder surveys, user
satisfaction ratings, or trust indices computed from system usage and incident data). This metric
recognizes that the ultimate success of such a system lies in its acceptance and the confidence it
inspires in those who use or oversee it. Stakeholder trust might encompass perceptions of
reliability, safety, transparency, and benefit. The Implementer shall gather feedback from key
stakeholder groups—e.g., end-users might be surveyed about their satisfaction and whether
•
•
•
•
•
24
they feel the system is fair and dependable; an oversight board might rate the system on
compliance and transparency. Over time, these should average out to above 90% favorable. If
trust dips (say due to an incident or misunderstanding), the Implementer should address the
root cause (for example, providing a clearer explanation for a decision, or improving a feature). A
high trust score is a strong indicator that the system is meeting its multifaceted goals in the eyes
of humans, which is the ultimate endorsement of compliance with the Specification’s spirit.
The Implementer shall compile the above metrics into regular reports (for example, a quarterly
compliance and performance report) to demonstrate ongoing adherence to the Specification. These
success metrics also serve as early warning signals: any decline in them suggests a potential
compliance drift that should be corrected proactively. In any dispute or evaluation (including audits by
the Authority), these metrics will be pivotal in assessing whether the Implementer has fulfilled its
obligations under this Specification.
11. Compliance and Verification
Ensuring and demonstrating compliance with this Specification is a continuous responsibility of the
Implementer. The following provisions govern how compliance is to be maintained, verified, and
enforced:
11.1 Documentation and Evidence: The Implementer shall maintain comprehensive
documentation and evidence of compliance with all aspects of this Specification. This includes, but is
not limited to: design documents mapping the System’s architecture to Specification requirements;
records of all self-improvements made by the System (with associated explanations and verification
proofs, per Section 6.3(3) and 6.3(4)); performance data showing adherence to resource bounds and
success metrics (Section 6.2 and 10.2); and security and ethics audit logs from the Audit Buffer
(Section 5.2). The documentation should also cover any manual procedures or controls in place (for
example, external validation procedures as per Section 9.2). All such records shall be kept up-to-date
and organized for review. Upon the Authority’s request with reasonable notice, the Implementer must
provide access to these materials to demonstrate the System’s compliance.
11.2 Audits by Authority: The Authority (or its authorized representative) has the right to audit the
System and the Implementer’s practices for compliance with this Specification. Audits may be scheduled
(e.g., periodic annual reviews) or ad hoc if the Authority has reason to believe there may be non-
compliance. During an audit, the Implementer shall provide the auditors with reasonable access to the
System, relevant personnel, and the documentation and evidence described in Section 11.1. This might
include allowing the auditors to inspect the System’s code (subject to appropriate confidentiality
protections), to observe the System’s operation, to review logs and improvement histories, and to verify
that all required safeguards and processes are in place and functioning. The Implementer shall not
unreasonably withhold information or access that is necessary for the Authority to verify compliance.
Audit procedures shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to the Implementer’s
business and does not compromise System security (for example, the Authority’s representatives must
comply with the Implementer’s security protocols during the audit). If an audit reveals any instance of
material non-compliance, the Authority may require a follow-up audit to confirm remediation (in
addition to any other remedies provided herein).
11.3 Notice of Non-Compliance: If the Implementer becomes aware of any fact, circumstance, or event
indicating that the System is not in full compliance with this Specification, the Implementer shall notify
the Authority in writing within 5 business days. Such notice must describe the nature of the non-
compliance in detail (e.g., “On [Date], the System deployed a self-modification that was later found to
violate an ethical constraint regarding data privacy, due to a flaw in the verification process”), and any
25
immediate steps taken to mitigate any issues arising from it. This obligation applies whether the non-
compliance was discovered internally (e.g., via the System’s own monitoring or an internal review) or
externally (e.g., a stakeholder complaint or incident). Prompt notification allows the Parties to
coordinate on response and remedy, and demonstrates good faith by the Implementer in maintaining
transparency. Failure to promptly notify can be considered a material breach of this Specification, as it
might allow problems to fester or harm to occur.
11.4 Remediation of Breach: In the event that any non-compliance or breach of this Specification is
identified (whether through an audit, by notice from Implementer, or otherwise), the Implementer
shall, at its own cost, promptly take all necessary actions to remedy the breach. This includes
halting any problematic processes (for example, pausing the self-improvement function if it’s behaving
inconsistently with the Specification), correcting any deficiencies in the System or its configuration, and
addressing any consequences of the breach (such as notifying affected stakeholders if required,
restoring lost data, or reversing unauthorized changes). The Implementer shall also investigate the root
cause of the breach and update the System or its procedures to prevent recurrence. Once remediation
is performed, the Implementer must notify the Authority and provide evidence of the measures taken.
The Authority may then verify the remediation (and indeed may require a re-audit as noted). If the
Implementer fails to promptly or adequately remediate, the Authority may declare the Implementer in
default of this Specification and pursue remedies as permitted (including termination per Section 13 or
legal action, depending on the governance of this agreement).
11.5 Compliance with Laws: The Implementer shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations
in connection with the development, deployment, and operation of the System, including (but not
limited to) data protection laws, industry-specific regulations, and any safety standards. Nothing in this
Specification shall be construed to require the Implementer to violate any law. In the event that a
provision of this Specification is found to be in conflict with a mandatory legal requirement (for
example, if a law requires retention of certain data longer than the Sustainable Renewal principle might
otherwise allow, or forbids a type of autonomous decision the System would make), the Implementer
shall notify the Authority of the conflict as soon as practicable. The Parties shall then confer in good
faith to modify this Specification (per Section 13, Amendments) or agree on an alternative approach to
compliance that both satisfies the law and preserves, as much as possible, the intent of this
Specification. The Implementer is also responsible for obtaining any regulatory approvals or
certifications that may be required for the System (for instance, if a government body needs to approve
AI systems for medical use, and the System is in that domain). Compliance with such external
requirements is solely the Implementer’s responsibility, though the Authority will reasonably cooperate
by providing information about the Specification if needed.
11.6 Representations of Compliance: The Implementer represents and warrants that as of the
Effective Date, it has disclosed to the Authority any known deviations or gaps between the System (or its
planned design) and the requirements of this Specification. Furthermore, the Implementer warrants
that the System, once fully implemented, will conform in all material respects to this
Specification. The Implementer shall not advertise, publish, or claim that the System is compliant with
the “Self-Improving Code Systems – Unified Architecture Specification v2.0” unless and until the System
has been objectively verified to meet all applicable requirements (whether through self-certification, an
independent audit, or certification by the Authority). Any misuse of the Specification’s name or
misrepresentation of compliance status will be considered a serious breach. Conversely, upon the
System achieving verified compliance, the Implementer is entitled to state that the System is “compliant
with [or certified to] the Unified Architecture Specification for Self-Improving Code Systems (Version
2.0)” in its documentation and marketing, provided that such statements are truthful and accompanied
by reference to any official certification if one was provided.
26
In summary, the Implementer is expected to actively manage compliance: monitor it, prove it, and
correct any deviations immediately. The Authority’s role is to oversee and verify, stepping in when
necessary to enforce these obligations. By adhering to Section 11, the Implementer helps ensure that
the lofty goals of this Specification are actually met in practice and sustained over the System’s life.
12. Warranty Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
12.1 Disclaimer of Warranties: The Implementer acknowledges that the Authority provides this
Specification “as is” and without any warranty or guarantee. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, the Authority disclaims all warranties, express or implied, regarding this Specification
and the feasibility, performance, or results of any System implemented according to it. This disclaimer
includes, but is not limited to: any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, title, non-infringement, or that implementation of the Specification will result in a successful
or error-free system. The Authority makes no representation or warranty that following this
Specification will ensure compliance with any law, achieve any particular performance level, or
guarantee that a Self-Improving Code System will be free of vulnerabilities or ethical issues. The
Implementer uses the Specification at its own risk and is solely responsible for outcomes. The Authority
does not warrant that the Specification is complete or free from errors, and any errors or ambiguities
discovered shall not be construed against the Authority.
12.2 Limitation of Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by law, under no circumstances will the Authority
be liable for any damages arising out of or related to this Specification or its use, regardless of the legal
theory and even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Specifically, the Authority shall not be liable
for:
- Direct Damages: Any direct losses or damages the Implementer incurs in connection with developing
or operating a System under this Specification. The Implementer understands that it bears all costs of
implementation and all risks of operational deployment.
- Indirect or Consequential Damages: Any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or
exemplary damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost savings, loss of data, business
interruption, or the cost of procuring substitute technology, arising from the Specification or any
System based on it. This exclusion applies even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose.
- Third-Party Claims: Any claims or demands made against the Implementer by third parties (including
end-users or regulators) due to the Implementer’s use of or reliance on this Specification, or the
operation of the System, except as expressly provided otherwise by applicable law.
The Implementer agrees that the Authority’s total cumulative liability, if any, for any claims, liabilities
or damages arising out of or in connection with this Specification (whether in contract, tort, or
otherwise) shall not exceed [the amount of One Thousand US Dollars (US $1,000)] or, if greater, the
total amount (if any) paid by the Implementer to the Authority specifically for the use of this
Specification. (If no payment was made for use of the Specification, this amount is zero.) This limitation
reflects the allocation of risk between the Parties and forms an essential basis of the agreement to
make this Specification available to the Implementer.
12.3 Implementer’s Responsibilities and Indemnification: The Implementer assumes all
responsibility and liability for the design, development, and operation of the System. The
Implementer is solely liable for any harm or damage resulting from the System’s actions or failures,
including any breaches of security, violations of law, or other losses. The Implementer shall indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless the Authority and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and
agents from and against any and all claims, actions, proceedings, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to: (a) the
27
Implementer’s use or implementation of this Specification; (b) the operation and performance of the
System (including any harm caused by the System to any person or property, or any alleged
infringement of third-party rights by the System); or (c) any breach by the Implementer of this
Specification. This indemnification obligation applies except to the extent that the claim or loss is
directly caused by the Authority’s gross negligence or willful misconduct (and in such case, any liability
of the Authority remains subject to all limitations and disclaimers in this Section 12). The Authority shall
promptly notify the Implementer of any claim for which it seeks indemnification and will allow the
Implementer to control the defense and settlement of such claim, provided that the Implementer shall
not settle any claim in a manner that imposes any non-monetary obligation or admission of fault on the
Authority without the Authority’s prior written consent.
12.4 Basis of Bargain: The Implementer acknowledges that the pricing, if any, for the Specification
(which may be free or minimal) reflects the allocation of risk set forth in this Section 12. The Authority
would not make the Specification available under these terms without such warranty disclaimers and
liability limitations. These terms are an essential part of the agreement between the Parties and will
survive and apply even if any remedy provided herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
13. Amendments and Updates
This Specification may be amended, modified, or updated from time to time, but only as described in
this section:
13.1 Mutual Written Agreement: No amendment or modification to the terms of this Specification
(including any change to the requirements, obligations, or other provisions herein) shall be valid or
binding upon the Parties unless it is made in a writing that explicitly references this Specification and is
signed by authorized representatives of both the Authority and the Implementer. Email or click-through
agreements are not sufficient unless otherwise agreed; a formal written instrument (which may be
executed in counterparts) is required to ensure clarity and mutual consent. This applies to any waivers
of rights as well (except as provided in Section 17, Waiver). For example, if the Implementer seeks an
exemption or variance from a particular technical requirement, it must be documented and agreed as
an amendment.
13.2 Specification Updates by Authority: The Implementer acknowledges that the field of self-
improving systems and related regulations may evolve, and the Authority may, from time to time,
publish updated versions of this Specification (e.g., Version 2.1, 3.0, etc.) to address new findings,
security issues, or improvements. The Authority will notify the Implementer in writing of any such
official update, providing a description of the changes and the rationale. Unless otherwise required by
law or agreed, such updates do not automatically amend this agreement; they are treated as
recommendations until adopted by mutual agreement. The Implementer and Authority may confer in
good faith regarding adoption of the new version. If both Parties agree to adopt the updated
Specification (with or without additional negotiated changes), they shall execute a written amendment
or replacement agreement to that effect. The Implementer should not unreasonably refuse to consider
updates that address critical security or ethical issues, and the Authority should give due consideration
to the Implementer’s feedback on feasibility and transition timing.
13.3 Minor Technical Adjustments: Notwithstanding the above, if the Authority issues minor technical
corrections to this Specification (such as fixing typographical errors, clarifying ambiguities without
changing meaning, or updating reference information) that do not materially affect the Implementer’s
obligations, the Authority may notify the Implementer of such corrections, and they shall be deemed
accepted and incorporated into the Specification unless the Implementer objects in writing within
28
30 days of notice. The Implementer’s objection should be limited to cases where the “correction” is
believed to introduce a substantive change. If the Implementer does object, the change will not take
effect for that Implementer unless resolved through mutual agreement.
13.4 Procedure for Amendments: In the event an amendment or new version is agreed upon, the
Parties shall clearly document: the effective date of the amendment or new version; whether it replaces
the Specification in whole or only adds/removes certain provisions; any transitional arrangements (e.g.,
the Implementer might have a grace period to implement new technical requirements); and any effect
on compliance status or certifications. Until such an amendment is effective, the Implementer’s
obligations and the Authority’s rights remain governed by the then-current accepted version of this
Specification.
13.5 No Unilateral Changes: Except as expressly allowed above (minor corrections with notice), neither
Party may unilaterally change the obligations under this Specification. The Implementer cannot claim
that an internal policy or technological change supersedes the Specification’s requirements; likewise,
the Authority cannot impose additional requirements on the Implementer beyond those in this agreed
Specification without an amendment.
This Section 13 ensures that the Specification remains a stable agreement but has a mechanism to
evolve by consent as needed. It protects the Implementer from being subject to unexpected new
requirements without agreement, and it allows the Specification to stay current through cooperative
updates.
14. Dispute Resolution
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Specification, or the
breach, termination, or validity thereof, the Parties shall engage in the following dispute resolution
process:
14.1 Good-Faith Negotiation: The Parties agree first to attempt to resolve any dispute informally and
amicably. A Party alleging a dispute shall notify the other Party in writing, describing the dispute in
reasonable detail. Within fifteen (15) business days of such notice, senior representatives of both the
Authority and the Implementer shall meet (in person or via video/teleconference) and attempt in good
faith to resolve the dispute through discussion and negotiation. Each Party shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to provide all information and documentation in support of its position to facilitate a
resolution. If the Parties reach an agreement during this negotiation, they shall document the
resolution in writing, which shall be binding upon the Parties.
14.2 Escalation to Executive Level: If the dispute is not resolved by negotiation within thirty (30) days
from the date of the initial dispute notice (or such longer period as the Parties may mutually agree in
writing), the dispute shall be escalated to a higher level of management. The Authority shall designate
an executive (e.g., a Director or VP level) and the Implementer shall designate an executive of
comparable authority to meet and confer about the dispute. These executives shall review the matter
and attempt in good faith to resolve it. If a resolution is reached at this stage, it shall be documented
and signed by both executives and will be binding.
14.3 Mediation (Optional): If the executives are unable to resolve the dispute within an additional
thirty (30) days (thus, roughly sixty (60) days after the initial notice of dispute), the Parties may
mutually agree to submit the dispute to non-binding mediation. The mediation shall be conducted
by a neutral third-party mediator experienced in technology contract disputes, to be selected by mutual
29
agreement or, failing agreement, by a reputable mediation service upon request of either Party. The
mediation shall take place in a mutually convenient location (or virtually) and each Party shall bear its
own costs and share the mediator’s fees equally. Mediation is a recommended step to facilitate a
mutually agreeable outcome, but it is voluntary; if either Party declines mediation, or if mediation fails
to resolve the dispute within a further thirty (30) days, either Party may proceed to binding resolution as
set forth below.
14.4 Binding Arbitration: Except for the specific circumstances provided in Section 14.6 (Injunctive Relief),
any dispute that remains unresolved after exhaustion of the above steps shall be finally settled by binding
arbitration. The arbitration shall be administered by [specify arbitration institution, e.g., the
American Arbitration Association (AAA) or International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)] under its
[e.g., Commercial Arbitration Rules or other appropriate rules] in effect at the time the arbitration is
initiated, except as modified herein. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be [City, Country], and
the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the English language (unless otherwise agreed by the
Parties).
The arbitration shall be decided by a single arbitrator, unless the Parties agree to three
arbitrators. The arbitrator(s) shall be neutral and independent, and shall be experienced in
software/technology agreements and, if possible, the subject matter of self-improving or AI
systems. If the Parties cannot agree on the arbitrator(s) within fifteen (15) days of the arbitration
demand, the arbitrator(s) shall be appointed by the administering institution in accordance with
its rules.
The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to award any relief or remedy that a court of competent
jurisdiction could award under law or in equity, including specific performance, injunctive relief
(subject to Section 14.6), and monetary damages, but shall not have authority to award any
damages or remedies expressly waived or limited by this Specification (such as punitive
damages, or any damages beyond the limitations in Section 12). The arbitrator(s) shall apply the
Governing Law specified in Section 15 to the merits of the dispute.
The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. Judgment on the award may be
entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree that the arbitrator’s award will
be the sole and exclusive remedy between them regarding any claims or counterclaims
presented to the arbitrator.
The Parties undertake to keep the arbitration proceedings and all associated documents
(including pleadings, evidence, and awards) confidential, except to the extent that disclosure is
required of a Party by legal duty, to protect or pursue a legal right, or to enforce or challenge an
award in bona fide legal proceedings.
14.5 Costs: Each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with the
negotiation and arbitration processes described above. The arbitrator(s) may, however, award the
prevailing Party its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees in the award, to the extent permitted by law or
the applicable arbitration rules, especially if it is determined that the other Party’s claims or defenses
were frivolous or conducted in bad faith.
14.6 Injunctive Relief: Notwithstanding the obligation to arbitrate disputes, either Party may seek
interim, provisional, or injunctive relief (such as a temporary restraining order or preliminary
injunction) from a court of competent jurisdiction at any time if necessary to prevent immediate and
irreparable harm that cannot be adequately remedied by monetary damages or by an arbitral award.
For example, the Authority may seek an injunction to halt the Implementer’s use of the Specification’s
name in a misleading manner, or the Implementer may seek an injunction to prevent the wrongful
disclosure of its confidential information by the Authority. Seeking such interim relief shall not be

deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate the underlying dispute, and once the immediate relief is
decided, the merits of the dispute will ordinarily be referred back to arbitration.
14.7 Continued Performance: During the dispute resolution process (including arbitration), the
Parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations under this Specification to the
extent feasible, and the Implementer shall ensure the System continues to operate in compliance with
the Specification (unless the issue in dispute is whether to halt operations for safety, etc.), so that end-
users or third parties are not adversely affected by the existence of the dispute.
This multi-step dispute resolution mechanism is designed to resolve conflicts efficiently and privately,
preserving business relationships and focusing on solutions. The Parties are encouraged to resolve
issues at the earliest possible stage (negotiation) and resort to arbitration only if necessary.
15. Governing Law
This Specification and any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with it (including non-
contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
[Jurisdiction], excluding its conflict of laws rules that would result in the application of the laws of
another jurisdiction. The Parties acknowledge that the chosen Governing Law governs the
interpretation of the Specification, the rights and obligations of the Parties, and all issues regarding the
validity of the Specification and any amendment or termination thereof.
By way of clarification, the reference to “laws of [Jurisdiction]” means the internal laws of the specified
state or country (and, if applicable, the federal laws of that country) that are applicable to agreements
entered into and performed entirely within that jurisdiction by residents thereof. The Parties expressly
agree to this choice of law in consideration of providing certainty and predictability in the enforcement
of this Specification.
If the Implementer is a governmental or public entity, nothing in this section shall prevent the
application of any mandatory law of the Implementer’s jurisdiction insofar as required for that entity,
but in all respects not mandated, the law of [Jurisdiction] shall apply.
16. Jurisdiction
Subject to the dispute resolution provisions of Section 14, the Parties agree that the courts of [specify
appropriate jurisdiction – e.g., the State of X and federal courts of Country Y, or a specific court]
shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any court proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Specification or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Implementer and the Authority each
irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any judicial action or
proceeding permitted by or related to this Specification, including but not limited to: (a) actions to
compel or stay arbitration, (b) actions to enforce or vacate an arbitral award, or (c) actions for interim
relief as allowed under Section 14.6.
Each Party hereby waives any objection it might have now or in the future to the laying of venue of any
such court proceeding in the courts specified above, and waives any claim that any such proceeding has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party also agrees that service of process in any such
action may be effected in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in this Specification (or by any
method of service permitted by the law of the jurisdiction where the court sits), and that such service
shall be sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the served Party.
31
For clarity, nothing in this Section 16 contradicts the obligation to arbitrate certain disputes; it simply
establishes where court actions (when they occur) will take place. The Parties understand that the
selection of a specific jurisdiction’s courts and law is a material term of this Specification to which they
freely agree.
17. Severability
If any provision of this Specification, or the application of any provision to any circumstance, is found by
a court or arbitral tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such
provision shall be deemed to be severed from this Specification and shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the remaining provisions. In such event, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Specification to implement their original intent as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible. If the
Parties are unable to agree on a modification, the tribunal may (to the extent permitted by law) amend
or interpret the invalid provision in a manner that renders it enforceable while achieving the same
economic and operational effect as intended. Any provision that is not deemed invalid or unenforceable
shall remain in full force and effect.
It is the express intent of the Parties that: (a) each provision of this Specification be construed in a
manner that renders it valid and enforceable, to the extent possible; and (b) if any provision is
nevertheless held invalid or unenforceable, then the tribunal is empowered to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the provision, delete any offending clause, or replace any term that is illegal or
unenforceable with a term that is legal and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
intention of the invalid term. This Section 17 shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve the
enforceability of this Specification to the maximum extent permitted.
18. Waiver
18.1 No Waiver Implied: No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power, or remedy
under this Specification shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, power, or remedy preclude any other or further exercise of that or any other right, power, or
remedy. The rights and remedies provided to each Party in this Specification are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.
18.2 Formal Requirements for Waiver: Any waiver of any provision, condition, or requirement of this
Specification must be explicitly made in writing and signed by the Party granting the waiver. Any such
waiver shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent obligation or breach of the same or any other
provision. For example, if the Authority waives the requirement for a particular audit in one instance,
that does not mean the Implementer is excused from future audits. Similarly, if the Implementer is
excused from meeting a deadline once, it does not mean deadlines are waived in general.
18.3 No Retroactive Waiver: A waiver shall apply only to the specific instance and purpose for which it
is given. No waiver by either Party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach
(whether similar or dissimilar in nature) or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence.
Both Parties acknowledge that they have entered into this Specification in reliance upon the clarity of its
terms and that this Section 18 is intended to ensure that modifications or relinquishments of rights do
not occur inadvertently or informally.
32
19. Entire Agreement
This Specification (including its Preamble, all numbered sections above, and any Appendices or
documents expressly incorporated by reference) constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding of the Parties with respect to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous oral or written agreements, understandings, negotiations, representations,
and proposals between the Parties relating to the same subject matter. Each Party acknowledges that
in entering into this Specification, it has not relied on any statement, representation, warranty, or
agreement of the other Party or any other person except for those expressly contained in this
Specification.
In case of any inconsistency between this Specification and any document or policy referenced herein,
the terms of this Specification shall prevail as between the Parties (unless an Appendix explicitly states it
overrides a specific provision of the main body and is signed or initialed by both Parties to that effect).
No supplement, modification, or amendment to this Specification shall be binding unless executed in
accordance with Section 13 (Amendments).
Each Party, by signing below (or by otherwise duly accepting this Specification in a manner agreeable to
both Parties), acknowledges that it has read and understood this Specification, and agrees to be bound
by its terms.
Appendix A: Reference Implementations
This Appendix (Informative) contains detailed examples and reference implementations that illustrate how the
requirements of this Specification can be met in practice. The examples may include pseudocode, actual code
snippets in various programming languages, or architecture diagrams for key components.
Topics and examples included in this Appendix may cover:
Core Algorithm Examples: Pseudocode demonstrating how to implement a function in
accordance with Section 3.1 (Square-Root Space Simulation) and Section 5.1 (Layer 1 –
Computational Core). For instance, a side-by-side comparison of a traditional algorithm versus a
refactored algorithm using O(√(n log n)) space.
Ethical Constraint Enforcement: A sample class or module (in pseudocode) showing how the
System checks ethical constraints at the proposal time of a modification (per Section 6.3(1) and
the code concept in Section 5.2 of the original Technical Specification). This might include a
dummy ethical rule and how the code prevents generating an option that violates it.
Unified Verification Proof Script: An example using a formal verification tool or logic to
generate a proof as required by Section 6.3(3). This could be illustrative (e.g., using a simplified
scenario in a theorem prover or model checker that verifies a code change preserves certain
properties).
Audit Trail Format: A template or data format for entries in the Audit Buffer (Section 5.2),
showing how information is structured (timestamp, component, change summary, verification
hash, etc.).
Continuous Evolution Workflow: A diagram or step-by-step walkthrough of how an
improvement moves through the Analyze → Synthesize → Verify → Deploy → Restore process
(Section 7.2), possibly annotated with where in code each step might be triggered, and how the
System ensures restoration of state.

All reference implementations in this Appendix are for illustration and are not normative; they serve to
guide Implementers. In case of any conflict between a reference implementation and the requirements
in the main body of the Specification, the main body shall govern.
Appendix B: Formal Proofs
This Appendix (Informative) contains or references formal mathematical proofs and analyses supporting key
claims in the Specification.
Key contents might include:
Space Complexity Proofs: A formal proof sketch of the statement from Williams (2025)
referenced in Section 3.1, demonstrating that any time-t computation can be simulated in O(√(t
log t)) space. This would involve complexity theory and possibly references to known theorems
or algorithms.
Catalytic Computing Correctness: A proof that a catalytic computing operation (using memory
and restoring it) does not impact the outcome of computations outside the operation, ensuring
it can be used without side-effects (relating to Section 3.2).
Tree Evaluation Space Bound Proof: A theoretical explanation of how the O(log n · log log n)
space bound for tree evaluation (Section 3.3) is derived, perhaps summarizing the breakthrough
algorithm’s approach for the interested implementer or auditor.
Unified Verification Feasibility: A discussion or proof-of-concept logic that verifying multiple
properties together does not exponentially increase complexity relative to verifying them
separately (to support Section 5.3.2 and Section 6.2 on overhead). It might reference formal
methods results that combined model checking of multiple properties can be done efficiently
under certain conditions.
No Trade-off Theorem: A theoretical argument, supported by references, reinforcing Section 9.1
and Section 9.2—namely, that achieving ethics without performance loss, security without
complexity increase, and sustainable evolution without decay are possible. This could refer to
any formal models or academic results that show, for example, that adding certain logical
constraints does not necessarily increase algorithmic complexity (with appropriate design).
These proofs are provided to bolster confidence in the Specification’s foundation and to guide advanced
implementers in understanding the limits of what is computationally feasible. They serve as a bridge
between cutting-edge theory and the practical requirements herein.
Appendix C: Migration Guide
This Appendix (Informative) provides step-by-step guidance for organizations transitioning existing systems to
comply with this Specification. It addresses practical considerations, acknowledging that many
Implementers may have legacy systems or partially compliant architectures. Topics include:
Gap Analysis Template: How to assess an existing system against each section of this
Specification. For example, a checklist or spreadsheet format listing each requirement
(Definitions, Architecture, Performance, etc.) with space to note current compliance level and
needed actions.
Incremental Adoption Strategy: Advice on implementing the Specification’s requirements in
stages (possibly paralleling the Phased Implementation in Section 10.1). For instance, start by
adding an audit logging component (to cover some compliance and easier to do), then integrate
ethical checks, then refactor core algorithms, etc., if doing so on an already deployed system.

Case Study: A hypothetical example of a legacy system (e.g., a recommendation engine with
some self-learning capacity) being migrated to a SICS compliant with this Specification. The case
study might narrate how the fictional company tackled each challenge: adding catalytic memory
use, merging security and ethics, rewriting parts of code for efficiency, etc., and the timeline over
which they achieved full compliance.
Tools and Resources: A list of tools, libraries, or frameworks that could assist in implementing
Specification features. This might include formal verification tools, AI ethics frameworks, logging
systems, memory management utilities, etc., with brief commentary on how they align with the
needs here.
Training and Cultural Shift: Recognizing that a specification like this might require changes in
developer practices, this part might offer tips on training development teams in formal methods
or ethical design, and establishing a culture that supports continuous self-improvement of
systems.
This Migration Guide is intended to help ensure that the Specification is not just an abstract ideal, but
an achievable standard for real-world systems. It does not impose additional requirements but offers
support for meeting the existing ones.
End of Formal Specification (Version 2.0, Unified Architecture Edition)
By adhering to the above terms and requirements, the Implementer and the Authority collectively affirm their
commitment to developing and maintaining Self-Improving Code Systems that are at once powerful, efficient,
secure, and ethically sound. This Specification provides an enforceable blueprint for such systems, ensuring
that innovation in artificial intelligence and software self-optimization proceeds with rigorous safeguards and
a principled foundation.
